I would first like to thank to my thesis supervisor, Professor Bonarini, for his patient guidance, enthusiastic encouragement and useful critiques of this work. I would also like to thank Dr. Davide Tateo, for his advice and assistance in keeping my progress on schedule. His willingness to give his time and effort so generously has been very much appreciated. 

I would also like to extend my thanks to my friends Branislav, Beste, Jacob and Jo\~ao, for their endless encouragement as my family in Milan, to In\~es, Iomhar, and Marko for the motivation they provide with their visit for my graduation, to Fran for his ideas for the quotations and his unfailing support.  

Finally, I must express my very profound gratitude to my mother and to Selahattin Bagcilar for their support and encouragement throughout my years of study, and to my father for providing a loving environment for me all his life.
